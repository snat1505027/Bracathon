CHALLENGE 4: ANALYSING DATA AND VISUAL TRENDS FROM THE FIELD

Our Vision:
     Creating a centralized data accumulation and analysis system to digitalize and accelerate the MIS data process.


Our Idea: 
1. Dynamic digital template generation with audio, video and image capture with caching ability
	- Different programme needs different type of data query, so we will make a drag and drop template generation which will allow the executive committee generate specific template for a task
	- Inclusion of audio, video and image data collected from field survey, will make data accumulation more accurate and impactful.
	- Sometimes there is network scarcity in rural area, in-app caching will allow better quality service henceforth. People can use these offline. 
2. Using smart Apis to transfer forms remotely, and controlled by a central server
3. Sentiment analysis from the field results
	- We plan to use machine learning to predict user sentiment, prosperity and the effectiveness of the programmes under MIS using the field data collected by the workers, along with the audio.
4. A Visual Data analysis tool made using machine learning to give insights about different statistical data and programme progress
	- Weâ€™ll use unsupervised learning to cluster people with similar financial background and infrastructure.
	- For visualizing higher dimensional data in 2-D or 3-D space, we intend to use two dimensionality reduction algorithms (t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis)), which are very popular in the data analytics community. 
5. A manual data entry option to integrate previous MIS data to the digital library
	- We want our new digital system to be integrated with the previous well built MIS data process, so We will have an option where workers can rewrite the manually handwritten scripts into digital copies.
6. An integrated tool with levels of user accessibility
